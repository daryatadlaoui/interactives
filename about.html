    <p> Hi! My name is Darya, and I'm a senior majoring in journalism, minoring in legal studies, and pursuing an integrated marketing communications certificate. I am motivated by the firm belief that people are products of their environment, and this worldview has inspired me to dedicate my career to advocating for those whose life circumstances have led them down difficult paths. </p>
    <p> One of my most formative experiences in the legal field has been interning with the Northwestern Prison Education Program, where I work closely with incarcerated students and have deepened my understanding of the injustices within the criminal justice system. I've also experienced day-to-day firm life as a former criminal attorney intern at Moghadassi & Khavari P.C., and I currently work as a paralegal at the Law Offices of Ian Hoffenberg, honing my understanding of civil disputes. </p>
    <p> Outside of work, I:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none">
      <li>Write for the Northwestern Undergraduate Law Journal</li>
      <li>Serve as Editor-in-Chief of Northwestern's Wavelength Magazine</li>
      <li>Serve as Features Editor of North by Northwestern</li>
      <li>Am a member of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Society</li>
      <li>Produce music (in my free time!)</li>
    </ul>
