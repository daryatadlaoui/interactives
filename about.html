    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Tadlaoui_Headshot_1.jpg" alt="Headshot" class="center">
    <p> Hi! My name is Darya, and I've always dreamed of becoming a criminal defense attorney. I am motivated by the firm belief that people are products of their environments, and that worldview inspires me to advocate for those whose life circumstances have led them down difficult paths. </p>
    <p> One of my most formative experiences in the legal field was interning with the Northwestern Prison Education Program, where I worked closely with incarcerated students and witnessed firsthand their wasted potential, have deepened my understanding of the injustices within the criminal justice system. I've also worked as an intern at Moghadassi & Khavari, where I honed my criminal understanding, and the Law Offices of Ian Hoffenberg, where I honed my civil understanding. </p>
    <p> Outside of work, I:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write for the Northwestern Undergraduate Law Journal</li>
      <li>Serve as Editor-in-Chief of Northwestern's Wavelength Magazine</li>
      <li>Serve as Features Editor of North by Northwestern</li>
      <li>Am a member of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Society</li>
      <li>Produce music (in my free time!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out through the following:</p>
