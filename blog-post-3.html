      <p>All James Soto wanted after spending 42 years in prison was a briefcase.</p>
      <p>So Jennifer Lackey, director of the Northwestern Prison Education Program (NPEP), bought him just that -- black, with a worn leather look -- and it gathered dust in her basement as Soto waited for his court date.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 14, 2023, just outside of Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Ill., Lackey presented Soto with the gift.</p>
      <p>“It was surreal,” Lackey said. “Here he is, in plainclothes, looking awesome, frankly, right on the other side of the wall.”</p>
      <p>Three months later, 62-year-old Soto is adjusting to a world that has aged with him. One thing is on his mind: taking the LSAT exam on April 12.</p>
      <p>Soto is determined to represent people like him -- people who, he believes, just need someone to take a second look at their case.</p>
      <p>“I know that by the time I get my degree, I'll be well past 65,” he said. “I may not do a lot of cases, but the ones I do, my intent is to come full force and give that person their freedom back,” he said.</p>

      <h2>“I knew that at some point, justice would prevail. Little did I know it was going to take over four decades.”</h2>
      <p> Soto grew up on Chicago's southwest side, his childhood marked by running through Cottage Grove's fields and serving as an altar boy at Our Lady of Hungary church.</p>
      <p>Things changed after the death of his cousin in 1979. Soto dropped out of high school and was working at United Parcel Service when he decided to join a gang.</p>
      <p>“I'm not proud of the decision,” he said. “It was probably, in a sense, revenge; I lost him to gang and gun violence. But I was never this hardcore member who hung out on a corner around the block.”</p>
      <p>In 1981, Soto and his cousin, David Ayala, were wrongfully accused of the murders of a 16-year-old girl and a former Marine in Piotrowski Park. The Chicago Police Department  arrested individuals affiliated with the Two-Six gang and used coercion tactics to elicit false confessions that led to the pair's eventual convictions in 1982.</p>
      <p>“When I heard those words, 'natural life without parole, I didn't think of it as a lifetime,” Soto said. “I knew that I didn't do it, and I knew that at some point, justice would prevail.”</p>
      <p>But entering Stateville Correctional Center, Soto had four decades ahead of him. When his first appeal was denied in 1985, he decided to get a job at Stateville's law library.</p>
      <p>“I knew I did not understand the law. I would get frustrated reading a legal decision from a higher court and not comprehending what the nuances were,” he said. “Light bulbs began to go off when I realized just how wrong this conviction was.”</p>
      <p>For the next 39 years, Soto would apply this legal knowledge not only to his ongoing case but to well past a thousand of his fellow inmates' cases, he said. He became what is known among prisoners as a “jailhouse lawyer” (though he prefers the term “legal advocate”): someone who assists with legal matters from behind bars.</p>
      <p>As he began drafting legal documents -- requests for post-conviction relief, clemency petitions, awards for “good time” credit -- and giving clients input on their cases, Soto struggled to find his footing.</p>
      <p>“I lost quite a number of [cases] because I wasn't prepared at that time to undertake such things,” he said. “But each and every time I gave it my all, and I knew if I kept doing that, eventually I would get those wins.”</p>
      <p>By 1987, his work began to pay off. After filing a petition for post-conviction relief, known as a collateral attack, he won an inmate a new trial.</p>
      <p>“That was one of my first victories, and I was very proud of that,” he said. “I couldn't replicate it right off the top -- the same good fortune I had with my first win -- but I got little wins. I became very well-known for framing arguments in such a way that would garner the attention of the court.</p>
      <p>Word about Soto's advocacy spread throughout the facility.</p>
      <p>“Jimmy helped countless people, and in doing so built an exceptional record of overturned convictions on various constitutional violations,” said Alann Vega, a Stateville inmate. “He was a respected man due to his authenticity, integrity and knowledge.”</p>
      <p>Brandon Perkins, a former Stateville inmate and NPEP student, came to Soto for help filing a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus. Soto gave him legal jargon to include in the document that would eventually lead to Perkins' release in October 2023.</p>
      <p>“I [got] a template from the law library, a fact sheet of what should be in there, and I swear, what he gave me was almost word-for-word what this template said,” Perkins said.</p>
      <p>All the while that Soto was helping to exonerate inmates, his own exoneration felt increasingly distant. He had filed proceedings at both the state and federal level -- a state-level collateral attack in 1991 and a federal habeas corpus petition in 1996 -- but by 2013, decades of back-and-forth litigation had ultimately resulted in a denial of any relief.</p>
      <p>“It was just not right,” he said. “I never could get the right counsel when I did pay for it, and of course the court-appointed counsel didn't fight as vehemently.”</p>
      <p>But in 2011, he was approached by Sergio Seritella of Northwestern University's Center on Wrongful Convictions who had acquired a dozen affidavits from state witnesses recanting their forced confessions.</p>
      <p>“I knew vaguely or conceptually that these people were mistreated, but to actually hear it in their words was just terrible,” Soto said. “It made me really think about the system overall, how menacing and predatory it can be when it wants to be."</p>
      <p>After hiring new counsel, Soto continued fighting his case, filing a second state-level collateral attack in 2017, reopening the federal habeas corpus petition and filing a clemency petition in 2020. Finally, in 2022, the First District Appellate Court ruled that Soto and Ayala were entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>

    <h2>“I am proud to say I am a graduate of Cohort One.”</h2>
      <p>With his case moving in the right direction, Soto decided it was time to pursue his education outside the tinny light of the law library. He applied for Northwestern's Prison Education Program (NPEP) -- a bachelor's degree-granting program for inmates in the Illinois Department of Corrections -- and was accepted into its first cohort of students.</p>
      <p>In the classroom, Soto was a “very positive force,” according to his former professor Mary Pattillo.</p>
      <p>“He has a very calm demeanor; he's energetic but not animated,” she said. “Sometimes we'd have debates where students disagreed with one another and he was always very reasonable in those situations.”</p>
      <p>In his later years with the program, Soto served as a teaching assistant for underclassmen, Perkins said.</p>
      <p>“If you asked him for help, he would help you without a doubt,” Perkins said. “He was one of those people.”</p>
      <p>Soto was part of the inaugural class of NPEP students who graduated inside Stateville's walls on Nov. 15, 2023.</p>
      <p>“I had so wanted to be released and come back in with a nice suit on, but I think that was a bit egotistical,” he said. “Call it divine intervention, but it all worked out for the best.”</p>
      <p>As he walked the stage, Soto received a standing ovation from the nearly 300-person audience of students, faculty, family members and political figures like Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss.</p>
      <p>“Nobody else got that,” recalled NPEP professor Marcia Grabowecky. “There were cheers, sure, but he's the one that brought the house down.”</p>

        <h2>“It was exhilaration.”</h2>
        <p>Almost exactly a month later, on December 14, Soto faced the crowd of family, friends and reporters outside of Stateville, his arms outstretched in a victory stance.</p>
        <p>Earlier that day, he'd been unexpectedly called into court for the resentencing hearing he had been waiting on for nearly a year. In the end, the judge granted the immediate release of him and his cousin.</p>
        <p>“When I heard those words, I felt a huge burden leaving me,” Soto said. “The weight of the world was suddenly off me. I really took a deep breath that I hadn't taken in a long time.”</p>
        <p>His former classmate Jacob Currey, also recently released from the facility, said the moment he saw Soto just outside the prison grounds was “unreal.”</p>
        <p>“It was a very special occasion; seeing his family there to support him, seeing him in street clothes,” he said. “It made me think, 'this is a great community to be in.'"</p>

    <section class="scroll-section">
        <h2>“It would be a dream come true.”</h2>
        <p>Since his release, Soto's mind has been on one thing: attending law school. He took the LSAT once while incarcerated but has spent the past three months studying to take it again in April.</p>
        <p>“If I were in his shoes, the last thing I would want would be going back to school with all this freedom and time,” said Joy Zhang, an NPEP tutor. “The fact that his commitment to that hasn't wavered even though he has so many new opportunities in the outside world is pretty admirable.”</p>
        <p>Soto is determined to make a difference.</p>
        <p>“I truly want to help others who are in a similar situation as me -- sitting in prison, hopeless,” he said. “I know I could've been out sooner had someone just taken the time to really look at my case.”</p>
        <p>For now, that means spending his days at the NPEP office on Northwestern's Evanston campus, working at the University of Chicago as a Justice Practitioner Fellow and studying in the library of Northwestern's Pritzker Law School.</p>
        <p>Attending Pritzker, he said, would be “a dream come true.” </p>
        <p>“First and foremost I wanted to get out, but having my J.D. was number two,” he said. “I know I had success as a prison advocate and I figured if I could emulate that in the outside world, I could be a successful lawyer.”</p>
        <p>Lackey “can't imagine that not coming true for him.”</p>
        <p>“He has worked so hard and fought for so long,” she said. “I saw him get his associate's degree, I saw him get his bachelor's degree and I just can't wait to watch him walk across the stage for the third time.”</p>
        <p>Pritzker Professor Annie Buth, who leads NPEP's Restorative Justice team, said he has “already accomplished far more than many practicing attorneys.”</p>
        <p>“It's pretty astounding,” she said. “I think there's a lot that law professors as well as practicing lawyers can learn from him.”</p>
        <p>Soto has also joined Professor Grabowecky's team of released students meeting with Illinois lawmakers in hopes of making reentry policies more beneficial.</p>
        <p>“One of the things we're trying to work on legally is making sure that, when people are released, they get the services they're entitled to, and that doesn't always happen,” Grabowecky said.</p>
        <p>Soto emphasized the importance of policy change as he prepares to file a lawsuit against the state for his wrongful conviction.</p>
        <p>“I will be compensated for these years, but there's no amount of money that can get me back my 20s, my 30s, my 40s and my 50s,” he said. “Nothing they could ever do can give that back to me.”</p>
        <p>But he's on his way to making “a big difference,” Perkins said. That faded black briefcase now holds the legal documents Soto examines as a volunteer paralegal.</p>
        <p>“Here comes this guy in his 60s, 42 years in prison, wrongly incarcerated, who comes home and graduates from law school,” Perkins said. “That'd be such a fucking story.”</p>
